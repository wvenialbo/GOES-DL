class GridSatProductLocatorB1(GridSatProductLocator):
    """
    Represent the GridSat-B1 imagery dataset product locator.

    This class implements the `GridSatProductLocator` abstract class for
    for the GridSat-B1 (Geostationary IR Channel Brightness Temperature
    - GridSat B1) imagery dataset product locator.

    Instances of this class are responsible for generating a list of
    folder paths based on the dataset's directory structure and naming
    conventions, product details, and a specified date range. The
    generated paths cover each year within the date range. Paths to the
    folders containing the initial and final dates are included in the
    list.

    Instances of this class are also responsible for verifying if a
    given filename matches the product filename pattern based on the
    dataset's naming conventions and product specifications, and for
    extracting the corresponding `datetime` information from the
    product's filename.

    The data in the GridSat-B1 dataset products comes from different
    sources and only a global view of the Earth is available, thus,
    the origin's name and scene identifier are not reflected in the
    product's path or filename, but the product's version is. The
    product's filename pattern is as follows:

    'GRIDSAT-B1.<yyyy>.<mm>.<dd>.<HH>.<version>.nc';

    where `<yyyy>` is the gregorian year number; `<mm>`, `<dd>` and
    `<HH>` are the month, day and hour, respectively, using two digits
    padded with zeros; and `<version>` is the product's version (e.g.
    'v02r01').

    The dataset is available from various services; see the Notes below
    for a list of supported sources. For Amazon Web Services (AWS) and
    Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the product's file path pattern is as
    follows:

    '<scheme>://<net-location>/data/<yyyy>',

    where `<scheme>` identifies the protocol's scheme (e.g. 's3', 'gs'),
    `<net-location>` is the hostname (e.g. 'noaa-cdr-gridsat-b1-pds' for
    's3', and 'noaa-cdr-gridsat-b1' for 'gs'), and  `<yyyy>` is the
    gregorian year number.

    The files are also hosted on the servers of the National Centers for
    Environmental Information (NCEI), the product's file path pattern is
    as follows:

    'https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/<path>/access/<yyyy>';

    where `<path>` is the project's data files folder name, i.e.
    'geostationary-ir-channel-brightness-temperature-gridsat-b1',
    and `<yyyy>` is the gregorian year number.

    Input is 3-hourly data from the International Satellite Cloud
    Climatology Project (ISCCP) with gridded 0.07°x0.07° spatial
    resolution that spans from 1980 to the present. Three total
    channels are available:

    - IR: CDR-quality infrared window (IRWIN) channel (near 11 μm);
    - WV: Infrared water vapor (IRWVP) channel (near 6.7 μm);
    - VIS: Visible channel (near 0.6 μm).

    Notes
    -----
    Only the AWS datasource is supported currently.

    Methods
    -------
    get_base_url(datasource: str) -> str:
        Get the base URL for the GridSat-B1 imagery dataset's products.
    next_time(current_time: datetime) -> datetime:
        Get the next time interval. GridSat-B1 dataset organises the
        data by year.
    normalize_times(datetime_ini: datetime, datetime_fin: datetime) -> tuple[datetime, datetime]:
        Normalise the initial and final datetimes.
    truncate_to_year(time: datetime) -> datetime
        Truncate the `datetime` to the current year.

    Caution
    -------
    Members of this class not defined by the `ProductLocator` interface
    are helper methods and can be considered as implementation details,
    even though they are defined as part of the public API. In future
    releases, these methods may be moved to a private scope, suffer
    name changes, or be removed altogether.
