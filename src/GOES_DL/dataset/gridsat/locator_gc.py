    """
    Represent the GridSat-GOES/CONUS imagery dataset product locator.

    This class implements the `GridSatProductLocator` abstract class for
    for the GridSat-GOES/CONUS (Geostationary Operational Environmental
    Satellites - GOES/CONUS) dataset product locator.

    Instances of this class are responsible for generating a list of
    folder paths based on the dataset's directory structure and naming
    conventions, product details, and a specified date range. The
    generated paths cover each year within the date range. Paths to the
    folders containing the initial and final dates are included in the
    list.

    Instances of this class are also responsible for verifying if a
    given filename matches the product filename pattern based on the
    dataset's naming conventions and product specifications, and for
    extracting the corresponding `datetime` information from the
    product's filename.

    The data in the GridSat-GOES/CONUS dataset products comes from GOES
    second generation (GOES-I to GOES-M) series, GOES-8 to GOES-15. The
    dataset provides data for two separate scenes: the entire GOES
    domain (Full Disk) and the CONUS domain (Contiguous United States).
    The scene and origin names are reflected in the product's path and
    filename, as does the product's version. The product's filename
    pattern is as follows:

    'GridSat-<SCENE>.<origin>.<yyyy>.<mm>.<dd>.<HH><MM>.<version>.nc',

    where `<SCENE>` is the scene name in uppercase (e.g. 'CONUS' or
    'GOES'); `<origin>` is the satellite identifier in lowercase (e.g.
    'goes08' to 'goes15'); `<yyyy>` is the gregorian year number;
    `<mm>`, `<dd>`, `<HH>` and <MM> are the month, day, hour and minute,
    respectively, using two digits padded with zeros; and `<version>` is
    the product's version(e.g. 'v01').

    The dataset's files are hosted on the servers of the NOAA's National
    Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), the product's file
    path pattern is as follows:

    'https://<net-location>/data/gridsat-goes/access/<scene>/<yyyy>/<mm>/',

    where `<net-location>` is 'www.ncei.noaa.gov', and `<scene>` is the
    scene name in lowercase (e.g. 'conus' or 'goes'). `<yyyy>` and
    `<mm>` are, respectively, the gregorian year number and the month
    number using two digits padded with zeros.

    Input is half-hourly data from the GOES second generation satellite
    series with gridded 0.04°x0.04° spatial resolution that spans from
    1994 to 2017. Six total channels are available

    Notes
    -----
    No datasource is supported yet.

    Methods
    -------
    get_base_url(datasource: str) -> str:
        Get the base URL for the GridSat-GOES/CONUS imagery dataset's
        products.
    next_time(current_time: datetime) -> datetime
        Get the next time interval. GridSat-GOES/CONUS dataset organises
        the data by month.
    normalise_times(datetime_ini: datetime, datetime_fin: datetime)
        -> tuple[datetime, datetime]
        Normalise the initial and final datetimes.
    truncate_to_month(time: datetime) -> datetime
        Truncate the `datetime` to the current month.

    Caution
    -------
    Members of this class not defined by the `ProductLocator` interface
    are helper methods and can be considered as implementation details,
    even though they are defined as part of the public API. In future
    releases, these methods may be moved to a private scope, suffer
    name changes, or be removed altogether.
