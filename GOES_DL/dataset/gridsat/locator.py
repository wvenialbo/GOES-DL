class GridSatProductLocator(ProductLocatorGG):
    """
    Abstract a product locator for GridSat family of imagery datasets.

    This abstract class implements the `ProductLocator` interface for
    a generic GridSat dataset product locator by inheriting from the
    `ProductLocatorGG` abstract class. The class implements the common
    specifications and naming conventions for products in the GridSat
    datasets, and serves as a base class for more specialised product
    locator classes. It also defines the common attributes and abstract
    methods for all GridSat dataset product locators.

    Instances of this class are responsible for generating a list of
    folder paths based on the dataset's directory structure and naming
    conventions, product details, and the specified date range. The
    generated paths cover each year or month interval within the
    required period according on the dataset's temporal granularity;
    paths to the folders containing the initial and final dates are
    included in the list.

    `GridSatProductLocator` objects are responsible for verifying if a
    given filename matches the product filename pattern based on the
    dataset's naming conventions and product specifications invoking the
    `match()` method, and for extracting the corresponding `datetime`
    information from the product's filename via the `get_datetime()`
    method.

    Also, the class provides the implementation for the abstract helper
    methods defined in the `ProductLocatorGG` abstract class. The
    `GridSatProductLocator` class is the workhorse for all GridSat
    dataset product locators.

    Notes
    -----
    Subclasses are responsible for initialising the attributes with the
    appropriate values for the dataset and product details, and provide
    implementation for the `get_base_url()` method declared by the
    `ProductLocator` interface. Definition for abstract methods declared
    by this class: `next_time()` and `normalize_times()` should also be
    provided. Refer to their individual documentation for details.

    Notes
    -----
    Currently, the 'Geostationary IR Channel Brightness Temperature
    - GridSat B1' and the 'Geostationary Operational Environmental
    Satellites - GOES/CONUS' datasets's products are supported.

    Attributes
    ----------
    file_date_format : str
        The specification of the date format used in the GridSat product
        filename.
    file_date_pattern : str
        The regex pattern of the date format used in the GridSat product
        filename.
    file_prefix : str
        The prefix for the GridSat product's filenames.
    name : str
        The name of the GridSat dataset product. A dataset can have
        multiple products. E.g. "B1", "GOES". Due to how the GridSat
        dataset is structured, the name is always a single string.
    origins : list[str]
        The list of origins of the GridSat product, namely one or more
        satellite identifier, e.g. "goes08". Multi-origin datasets, like
        GridSat-B1, set this attribute to an empty list.
    path_date_format : str
        The specification of the path's date format convention used in
        the dataset.
    path_prefix : str
        The path prefix to the dataset directories.
    versions : list[str]
        The version or list of versions of the GridSat product; e.g.
        "v01r01".

    Methods
    -------
    get_date_format() -> str:
        Return the date format specification for the GridSat product's
        filename.
    get_paths(datetime_ini: datetime, datetime_fin: datetime) -> list[str]:
        Generate a list of paths containing the product files for the
        specified date range.
    get_prefix() -> str:
        Generate the prefix for the GridSat product's filename.
    get_suffix() -> str:
        Generate the suffix for the GridSat product's filename.
    get_timestamp_pattern() -> str:
        Return the timestamp pattern for the GridSat product's filename.
    next_time(current_time: datetime) -> datetime:
        Get the next time interval.
    normalize_times(datetime_ini: datetime, datetime_fin: datetime) -> tuple[datetime, datetime]:
        Normalise the initial and final datetimes.

    Caution
    -------
    Members of this class not defined by the `ProductLocator` interface
    are helper methods and can be considered as implementation details,
    even though they are defined as part of the public API. In future
    releases, these methods may be moved to a private scope, suffer name
    changes, or be removed altogether.
