class ProductLocatorGG(ProductLocator):
    """
    Abstract a GridSat or GOES-R series dataset product locator.

    This class implements the `ProductLocator` interface and serves as
    a base class for product locators of the GridSat and GOES-R series
    datasets. It also defines common abstract methods that subclasses
    must implement to provide dataset-specific product utilities.

    Instances of this class are responsible for verifying if a given
    filename matches the product filename pattern based on the dataset's
    naming conventions and product specifications by means of its method
    `match()`, and for extracting the corresponding `datetime`
    information from the product's filename through the use of the
    `get_datetime()` method.

    Notes
    -----
    Subclasses must implement the following methods: `get_base_url()`
    and `get_paths()` declared by the `ProductLocator` interface.
    Implementations for abstract methods declared by this class:
    `get_date_format()`, `get_prefix()`, `get_suffix()`, and
    `get_timestamp_pattern()` should also be provided. Refer to their
    individual documentation for details.

    Methods
    -------
    get_date_format() -> str:
        Return the date format specification for the product's filename.
    get_datetime(filename: str) -> datetime:
        Extract the `datetime` from the product's filename.
    get_filename_pattern() -> str:
        Return a regular expression pattern for the product's filename.
    get_prefix():
        Return the prefix for the product's filename.
    get_suffix():
        Return the suffix for the product's filename.
    get_timestamp_pattern() -> str:
        Return the timestamp regex pattern for the product's filename.
    match(filename: str) -> bool:
        Verify if a provided filename matches the required format.
    timestamp_to_datetime(timestamp: str) -> datetime:
        Convert a timestamp string to a UTC `datetime` object.

    Caution
    -------
    Members of this class not defined by the `ProductLocator` interface
    are helper methods and can be considered as implementation details,
    even though they are defined as part of the public API. In future
    releases, these methods may be moved to a private scope, suffer name
    changes, or be removed altogether.

        string is used to parse the product's filename and extract the
